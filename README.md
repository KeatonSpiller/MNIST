# MNIST
MNIST 0-9 classification with Neural Networks

* Python version 3.10 or later
* Jupyter Notebook

1. Load training and test images

2. Shape the dimensions

3. Change the Hyper parameters
n to determine how many hidden nodes
eta to modify the Learning Rate
momentum to push out of a local minimum
and epoch to train for longer

* n =  100 # hidden nodes
* eta = 0.1 # Learning Rate
* momentum = 0.9
* epoch = 50

4. Run the code block with the epoch for loop to train the weights

5. Run the training accuracy plot

6. Run the test data with the trained weights

7. Run the confusion matrix displaying predicted vs actual number classifications
